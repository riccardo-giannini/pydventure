# this is just an sqlite3 test, so that i can try to connect to an existing
# DB and try to do some sandboxing and build something that instantiates a DB and do
# stuff.

# on a second thought, it's probably more efficient if i just wrap around an ORM
# (object relationship manager) so that I don't have to deal with a lot of complicated
# instantiation stuff
# I think I will use sqlalchemy
